                        <p>We have built our own, powerful Short URL system, allowing you to reduce the number of characters in your message. However, unlike others you may have seen, ours generates a unique URL for every SMS you send. This means you receive a report on every mobile number who clicks your link! We can even customise this URL to your own specification, making it relevant to your brand.</p>
